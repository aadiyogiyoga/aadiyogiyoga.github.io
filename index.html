          <h4>Asanas</h4>
          <p>In yoga, an asana is a posture in which a practitioner sits. In the Yoga Sutras, Patanjali defines "asana" as "to be seated in a position that is firm, but relaxed".</p>

          <h4>Pranayamas</h4>
          <p>Pranayama is the formal practice of controlling the breath, which is the source of our prana, or vital life force. Here, read up on pranayama exercises & poses, breathing techniques and sequences.</p>

          <h4>Kriyas</h4>
          <p>In Kundalini Yoga a kriya is a series of postures, breath, and sound that work toward a specific outcome. Practicing a kriya initiates a sequence of physical and mental changes that affect the body, mind, and spirit simultaneously.</p>

          <h4>Meditation</h4>
          <p>Meditation is that which gives you deep rest. Meditation is an activity in which the practitioner just sits and allows the mind to dissolve.</p>

          <h4>Yoganidra</h4>
          <p>Yoganidra is a state of consciousness between waking and sleeping. It is a state in which the body is completely relaxed, and the practitioner becomes systematically and increasingly aware of the inner world by following a set of verbal instructions. </p>
